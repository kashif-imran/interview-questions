Java synchronised blocks can only block threads sunning in the same VM. If you are in a clustered environment where there are multiple threads coming
from multiple different VMs then the synchronised blocks will not block them

To block them you have to design some mechanism yourself or use some DB tool or use some open source tool that provides that functionality
